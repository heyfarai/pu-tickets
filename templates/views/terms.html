        <h3>Refunds</h3>

        <p>You registration is non-refundable once purchased. Cancellations of your travel and/or hotel reservations are your own responsibility. Please notice, that if you can't attend for any reason you are responsible to cancel your room and flights.</p>

        <h3>Transferring your Ticket</h3>

        <p>We know that things can happen, which lead to the fact that you can't attend. As we do not refund any tickets, we give you the opportunity to transfer your ticket to another person. Ticket changes though cost time that we, the closer we get to the event, do not have. Therefore all changes 4 weeks prior an event are free. Changes after that date cost R350. However, we are not able to transfer your registration after a certain date. So be sure to let us know as soon as possible if you can't attend. Name changes within 14 days before an event can not be issued.</p>

        In summary that means:
        <ul>
        <li>Name changes 4 weeks before an event are free</li>
        <li>Name changes between 4 and 2 weeks before an event will incur a administration fee of R350</li>
        <li>Name changes within 2 weeks before an event can not be made</li>

        <h3>Cancellation</h3>

        <p>The organisers can change the date of the event or cancel the event due to low numbers of registrations. If the event is cancelled any registered attendee gets back the full entrance fee. If a part of your registration – e. g. a workshop – is not taking place you get back the fee for the booked part, excluding the fee for the parts you still attend. Further claims against the organiser are not possible. In case that a trainer is not able to give the workshop, the organiser has the right to find an adequate replacement.</p>

        <h3>Prices</h3>

        <p>All prices mentioned on this website do not include VAT. All conference and workshop tickets also include the booking fee. The ticket price for the conference and the workshops does not cover any travel or accommodation.</p>

        <h3>Accessibility</h3>

        <p>Please contact us, if you want to attend at workshops or the conference and have any special requirements such as access for wheelchairs. We will do our very best to accommodate you.</p>

        <h3>Photos, Videos and Quotes</h3>

        <p>It may happen that we shoot videos and photos at the event. With your registration you grant us the right to use such material taken over the days. Quotes given on interviews, twitter or on our feedback forms maybe used for future event marketing. Fully credited wherever possible of course.</p>

        <p>If you want to take photos, we are happy that you want to share them with the other attendees and publish them. Let us know where to find them and we gonna tell the other attendees about it. The official hashtag to be used is #pixelup. Video and sound recording of any session or workshop at the whole event is NOT permitted unless permission is given by the organiser of the event.</p>
