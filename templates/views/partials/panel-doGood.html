                    <p>For PIXEL UP! 2016 we've reserved 2 bursary tickets to help deserving, skilled folks who, due to hardship, can't afford to attend. We work with local organisations to identify people who could benefit. </p>
                    <p>Part of your attendance fee will go towards funding theses 2 seats for the conference. We believe that digital design skills are essential to the African economy. <strong>A rising tide lifts all boats.</strong></p>
